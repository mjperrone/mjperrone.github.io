<p>Okay that was a lot of stuff I just talked about. Does anyone have any questions?<br>&lt; 1 second pause &gt;<br>No questions? Moving on…<br>&lt; question now forms in listeners head but they don’t ask or have to interrupt &gt;</p>

<p>I see this situation happen a lot. People need time to process the prompt for questions, consider what they just heard and form the right words to ask it. There is research on this phenomenon, mostly in education.</p>
<p>Their conclusion is to wait at least 3 seconds. I personally think counting to 5-7 is better. As the speaker, this is a great time to take a sip of water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elementary science teachers allow an average of one second for a response to a question, and follow a student response by a comment within an average of nine-tenths of a second. When these two “wait times” are extended to three to five seconds, a number of changes occur in student variables. There are increases in the length of the response, the number of unsolicited appropriate responses, student confidence, incidence of speculative responses, incidence of child-child data comparisons, incidence of evidence-inference statements, frequency of student questions, and incidence of responses from “relatively slow” students.</p>
