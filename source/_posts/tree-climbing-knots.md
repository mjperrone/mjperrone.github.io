| Knot name | Situation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Figure 8 | Stopper knot: don't fall off the end of your rope |  |
| Bowline | attach throw line to throw bag |  |
| Clove hitch | attach the throw line to rope |  |
| Double Fisherman's | Attaching carabiner to end of rope in MRS. | This is a cinching knot so no risk of side loading the carabiner compared to double fishermanâ€™s |
| VT=valdotaine tresses | One way friction prusik | Nate suggested |
|  |  |  |
| [Gasket coil](https://www.animatedknots.com/coil-unattached-rope-knot) with slip finish | Throw rope over a branch | Just like the gasket coil storage knot, but finish with a bite through the loop and hold the bite. Throw from there. |
| Distel hitch | One way friction prusik | Nate suggested |
| Michoacan hitch | One way friction prusik | Nate suggested |
| Bowline Yosemite finish | Rope end termination knot to attach rope to carabiner | Nate uses. Bino recommends using a cinching knot like the anchor, double fisherman's, and buntline if the carabiner space is small (single rope through cinching) |
| Double figure eight | Tie in for rock climbing fall arrest belay systems | Why don't climbers use fisherman's? |
| Alpine butterfly | - load bearing loop midline
- bypass a damaged section of rope in a pinch
- thread rope threw to cinch a canopy anchor (w/ or w/out quickie) | Nate suggested advanced |
| English Prusik | Two way friction prusik - 2 in 1 lanyard |  |
| Running Bowline | SRS base anchor | w/Nate we tied it midline with a bight |
